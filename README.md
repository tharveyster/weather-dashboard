# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project is a weather dashboard that was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, and the Open Weather API.

When you enter a city, it gives the current weather conditions, and a 5-day forecast. The city is then added to the search history and saved to `localStorage` so that refreshing the page will not remove the search history.

Clicking on cities in the search history will return you to the weather for that city.
